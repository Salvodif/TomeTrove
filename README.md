## üì¶ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/salvodif/TomeTrove.git
    cd TomeTrove
    ```

2.  **(Recommended) Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    
    # On Linux / macOS
    source venv/bin/activate
     
    # On Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell)
    .\venv\Scripts\activate 
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```txt
    textual
    tinydb
    textual-autocomplete
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install ExifTool (External Dependency for Metadata):**
    TomeTrove uses ExifTool to update file metadata (e.g., author, title in PDFs).
    *   Download from the [ExifTool Official Website](https://exiftool.org/).
    *   Follow their installation instructions for your operating system.
    *   Make sure its path is correctly configured in `config.json` or via the in-app settings.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Before the first run, or to customize paths, create/edit the `config.json` file in the same directory as `main.py`.
An example template can be found in the file `config.json.template`.
Here's an example structure (adjust paths for your system):

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "tinydb_file": "library.json",
    "library_path": "/path/with/yours/pdfs",
    "upload_dir_path": "/default/path/where/look/for/pdf/to/upload",
    "exiftool_path": "/exiftool/path/exiftool.exe",
    "log_dir": "/logs/path" 
  }
}
```
*   `tinydb_file`: Name of the TinyDB database file (e.g., `library.json`). It will be created inside your `library_path`.
*   `library_path`: The root directory where your book files will be organized (by author) and stored. **This is a critical path.**
*   `upload_dir_path`: Default directory the file browser will open to when adding new books.
*   `exiftool_path`: Full path to the ExifTool executable. **Required if you want file metadata to be updated.** For Windows, this would end in `.exe`. For Linux/macOS, it's usually just `exiftool` if it's in your system's PATH, or the full path to the executable.
*   `log_dir`: Directory where log files will be stored (can be relative to the script or an absolute path).

You can also configure these paths through the **Settings screen (`Ctrl+S`)** within the application after the first run.

## üõ†Ô∏è Auxiliary Scripts (in `tools/` directory)

The `tools/` directory contains several utility scripts to help manage your TomeTrove library and data.

### ‚û§ `import_calibre_to_tinydb.py`

This script is designed to import your existing book library from a Calibre export into TomeTrove's TinyDB database.

**Functionality:**
*   Reads a JSON file exported from Calibre (containing book metadata).
*   Copies book files (PDFs and other formats) from their original Calibre locations to the TomeTrove `library_path`, organizing them into author-specific subdirectories.
*   Attempts to update PDF metadata (title, author, tags) using ExifTool.
*   Creates corresponding entries in the TomeTrove `library.json` database.
*   Logs the import process, including any errors encountered.

**Usage:**
1.  **Export your Calibre library to JSON:**
    *   You can use Calibre's `calibredb list` command-line tool. Refer to the official Calibre documentation for detailed instructions: [calibredb list documentation](https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/generated/en/calibredb.html#list).
    *   A typical command might look like this (run from your terminal/command prompt):
        ```bash
        calibredb list --for-machine --fields authors,title,formats,tags,series,series_index,comments,last_modified > calibre_books.json
        ```
        This command exports the specified fields for all books into a JSON file named `calibre_books.json`. Make sure to include at least `authors`, `title`, and `formats`.
2.  **Place `calibre_books.json`:** Put the exported JSON file in the same directory as `import_calibre_to_tinydb.py` or specify its path when running the script (currently, the script defaults to looking for `calibre_books.json` in its own directory).
3.  **Configure Paths:** Ensure your `config.json` for TomeTrove has the correct `library_path` (where books will be copied) and `exiftool_path`.
4.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python tools/import_calibre_to_tinydb.py
    ```
    *   The script will process the JSON, copy files, and create/update your `library.json`.
    *   Check the generated log file in the `logs/` directory (as specified in `config.json` or the script's default) for details and any errors.

**Important Notes for `import_calibre_to_tinydb.py`:**
*   The script assumes that the paths to your book files listed in the Calibre JSON export are accessible from where you run the script.
*   It tries to handle different text encodings for the JSON file but UTF-8 is preferred.
*   PDFs for which metadata update via ExifTool fails will be copied to a `02 - PDF no metadata updated` directory within your `library_path`.
*   Non-PDF files (e.g., EPUB, MOBI) associated with a book are copied to a `01 - non-PDF` directory within your `library_path`.

### ‚û§ `add_tags_in_db.py`

This utility script allows you to pre-populate or update the `tags` table in your TomeTrove `library.json` database with a predefined set of tags and their associated icons.

**Functionality:**
*   Connects to your `library.json` database.
*   Iterates through a predefined dictionary of tag names and icons.
*   If a tag already exists by name, it updates its icon.
*   If a tag does not exist, it inserts a new tag entry with the name and icon.

**Usage:**
1.  **Modify `tags_data` (Optional):** Open `tools/add_tags_in_db.py` and edit the `tags_data` dictionary if you want to change the default tags or their icons.
2.  **Specify Database Path:** Ensure the line `db = TinyDB('test_library.json')` (or similar) in the script points to your actual `library.json` file, which should be located within your configured `library_path`.
    *   *Recommendation:* It's best to modify this script to read the `library_path` and `tinydb_file` from your main `config.json` for consistency, rather than hardcoding `test_library.json`.
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python tools/add_tags_in_db.py
    ```
    The script will print messages indicating which tags were added or updated.

### ‚û§ `checkpdf.py`

This script helps verify the integrity of your TomeTrove library by checking if the book files referenced in your `library.json` database actually exist at their expected locations within your `library_path`.

**Functionality:**
*   Reads your main `config.json` to get the `library_path` and `tinydb_file` path.
*   Iterates through all book entries in your `library.json`.
*   For each book, it constructs the expected file path (based on author and filename).
*   Checks if the file exists at that path.
*   Reports any missing files or entries with missing filename/author information.
*   Uses `colorama` for colored terminal output to highlight issues.

**Usage:**
1.  Ensure your main `config.json` is correctly configured with the paths to your library and database.
2.  Run the script from the root directory of your TomeTrove project:
    ```bash
    python tools/checkpdf.py
    ```
    The script will output a summary of any problems found.

### ‚û§ `count_non_pdf.ps1` (PowerShell Script)

This is a PowerShell script designed to count the number of non-PDF files present within a specified import/upload directory. It's useful for getting a quick overview before or after an import process if you're primarily interested in PDF files.

**Functionality:**
*   Prompts the user to enter the path to the directory to scan (defaults to the current directory if none is provided).
*   Recursively searches the specified directory and its subdirectories.
*   Counts all files that do *not* have a `.pdf` extension.
*   Outputs the total count of non-PDF files found.

**Usage (Windows PowerShell):**
1.  Open PowerShell.
2.  Navigate to the `tools/` directory:
    ```powershell
    cd path/to/TomeTrove/tools
    ```
3.  Run the script:
    ```powershell
    .\count_non_pdf.ps1
    ```
4.  When prompted, enter the path to the directory you want to analyze, or press Enter to scan the current directory (`tools/`).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

*   **Metadata Updates**: File metadata updating (e.g., for PDFs) relies entirely on a correctly installed and configured ExifTool. If ExifTool is not found, misconfigured, or encounters an error with a specific file, metadata won't be updated (though the book will still be added to the TomeTrove library).
*   **File Organization**: Books are organized into subdirectories by author name within the main `library_path`. Renaming authors directly in the database will not automatically move or rename the corresponding physical files/folders.
*   **Error Handling**: While basic error handling and logging are implemented, complex edge cases or file corruption issues might not always be gracefully handled.
*   **No Cloud Sync**: TomeTrove is a local application. For cloud synchronization of your library, you would need to manage the `library_path` directory (containing your books and `library.json`) and `config.json` using a third-party service like Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud, Syncthing, etc.
*   **Single User**: Designed as a single-user local application.
*   **Scalability**: For extremely large libraries (tens of thousands of books), TinyDB performance might eventually degrade.
